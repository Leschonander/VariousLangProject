Small CSS library/framework made for personal use, but available for public use if anyone wants to use it. 
Realized that for many personal projects in Python I was defaulting for the same styling, so it made sense to codify the CSS code into
a library/framework of sorts.

Currently in alpha, less due to product reasons but more I haven't added all the code I use to style all my flask apps with here yet.
