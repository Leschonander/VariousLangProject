# Lime Bike Data Visualization Project 

A exercise in dashboarding. 

Used d3, leaflet.js, and turf.js to visualize roughly a months worth of data on the average position of Lime bikes and scooters in the D.C. area.

To run, clone the files and then run `python api.py`. Then go to the `index.html` page and a map and line chart should appear.

Prototype versions where the map and chart were separate, along with not calling data from the database are on my bl.ocks.org account. 

For a aproximate version that does not require cloning the repository, look at the following:
